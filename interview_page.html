	</div>
	<div class="p3">
		<p>R: Hi Leanne. Nice to meet you. My name is Rachel.<br> Did you have a good winter break?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p4">
		<p>L: Yes, I stayed at home for the <br> whole winter break.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p5">
		<p>R: Where are you from?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p6">
		<p>L: I am from Shanghai.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p7">
		<p>R: Oh, Shanghai! I am from Suzhou. We are so close. What <br> did you do, or did you go anywhere? Travel around?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p8">
		<p>L: Yes, so I stayed here till 26th because my parents<br> came and then I went back to Vancouver because I<br> was studying there for the high school and I stayed<br> at Vancouver for the whole winter break.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p9">
		<p>L: Yes. How's the weather in Suzhou.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p10">
		<p>R: Um, I mean it's cold, but it's not as cold as in New <br> York. There's not much wind, which is acceptable. I<br> don't have to wear as much clothes as here. How's the<br> weather in Vancouver?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p11">
		<p>L: It's also hotter than New York..</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p12">
		<p>R: Really? It's in Canada I mean.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p13">
		<p>L: Yes. Even though there's the snow, but<br> I still think it's ok because New York it still<br> much colder than Vancouver.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="p14">
	<p>R: Ok. How's the Christmas in New York because <br> I never spend Christmas in New York. It like my<br> birthday is on Christmas so like I always go home<br> and spend my Christmas with my family. So I am<br> just curious about Christmas.</p>
