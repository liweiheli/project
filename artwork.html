  <h1>Boris Tellegen</h1>
  <p>This is an artwork from Boris Tellegen. He's my <br>
    favorite artist and I have known him since the high<br>
     school. His works often catch my attention as I <br>
     love the contrast between the complexity and negative<br>
      space, which creates a great intensity. He often uses <br>
      multimedia of paper, wood and colors to make artworks.<br>
       As in this piece, I can see the traces of pencil marks<br>
       and the spreading color of spray paintings and the cutting<br>
        out shapes of white areas. Especially the feature of over <br>
        layering papers that creates dimensionality to the work,<br>
        which I can see the chaos in the order; vice versa. This<br>
        is not a typical graphic design, but I like the most.</P>

  <h1>Takashi Kono</h1>
  <p>This is an artwork from a famous Japanese designer<br>
    Takashi Kono. He's famous for his artwork "fish". <br>
    I really like this work that how he has used really <br>
    light soft colors to create a strong impression in <br>
    my mind. And how he uses simple shapes and stacks <br>
    them together in a image. It looks abstract, but <br>
    also connected. His work looks like the combination<br>
     of traditional Japanese art with the constructivism <br>
     from the western art. Even though it's an abstract <br>
     picture, I imagined as 3 flowers in a vase that <br>
     stands on the table. It's very pleasing.</P>

  <h1>Paula Scher</h1>
  <p>This is an artwork form Paula Scher, who's a really<br>
    famous graphic designer. I had once seen her videos<br>
    and got inspired form her works. This is a map she<br>
    drew with paints. And every shape and area are<br>
    presented by letters and words. There are more maps<br>
    she has created like this for different parts of<br>
    world and countries. I chose this one because I<br>
    like the contrast of between the colors that there<br>
    are some very bright ones and some dark ones. This<br>
    work let me sees the possibility of how words and<br>
    typography can be transformed into arts and how they<br>
    made our world. I think it's both creative and literal<br>
    that when we are seeking for a place, we would look<br>
    for the street name, and this map is totally created<br>
    by the names. However, she has said that she put all<br>
    the names down by instinct and feelings, which by<br>
    looking in the detail, some information is wrong,<br>
    which delivers the idea of lies under the surface<br>
    that we often receive the wrong information.</P>
